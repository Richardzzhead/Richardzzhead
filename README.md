- 👋 Hi, I’m @Richardzzhead
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding code and learning to write my own applications someday
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to freaking add applications to discord without losing my mind
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment cause im still on monkey brain time
- 📫 you can reach me (knowing no one will see this) if you just search up my name on most social media
